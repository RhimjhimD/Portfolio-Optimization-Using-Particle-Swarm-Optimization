# Portfolio-Optimization-Using-Particle-Swarm-Optimization
This study aims to build an optimal portfolio from NIFTY50 stocks to minimize risk and maximize returns. After initial screening of 50 stocks, weights are assigned to the selected ones, providing investors with a proportional wealth distribution strategy for effective portfolio allocation and risk management.
Data: The sample for this study consists of all the NIFTY50 stocks. The period of the study is from April 2018 to March 2023. There are altogether 50 stocks and their Monthly Closing Price from April 2018 to March 2023 are collected. We then calculate their monthly return using their Monthly Closing Price (CP) values over time.
Methods: 
1. Selection of Stocks - The stocks whose average returns are negative are excluded from consideration. Subsequently, attention is given to stocks that are left-skewed. Negative skewness in return distributions is a critical consideration for investors due to its indication of an asymmetric risk profile. It signifies a higher likelihood of extreme negative returns, emphasizing the importance of downside protection. In the subsequent stage, it is necessary to compute both the SD of the monthly returns and the Beta coefficient for every company included in the portfolio. The standard deviation (SD) serves as a comprehensive gauge of the total risk in an investment, encompassing both unsystematic and systematic risks. It quantifies the extent of deviation of returns from their mean, providing a valuable measure of the investment's overall risk profile. This analysis contributes to a more nuanced understanding of the risk dynamics associated with each company in the portfolio. Beta (Î²), which quantifies the systematic risk of an investment relative to the market, is determined using a specific formula. This metric helps investors gauge how an asset's returns correlate with broader market movements, providing insights into the investment's overall risk characteristics. Following this, the selection process entails identifying stocks with a standard deviation (SD) lower than the aggregated SD and a beta higher than the average value of beta. This selection is facilitated through the creation of a 4-quadrant Map, where SD and beta are plotted on the respective axis. The map visually represents the place of each stock concerning the average beta and combined SD. Further analysis is conducted on stocks positioned in the second quadrant of the map, indicating lower standard deviation (SD) and higher beta values relative to the averages. This strategic selection process aims to identify stocks with specific risk-return characteristics aligned with the defined criteria.
2. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) - The average return is calculated by taking a grand average return of the final stocks and the risk is calculated using variance and covariance of the final stocks. The Markowitz formula involves estimating the expected returns and variances of individual assets, as well as the covariances between pairs of assets. Taking into account these variables, the formula computes the allocations of each asset within the portfolio, with the goal of optimizing returns while maintaining a specified level of risk. The Markowitz formulation, often referred to as mean-variance optimization, forms the basis for portfolio construction by identifying the optimal combination of assets that lies on the efficient frontier.

How to Run: The selection of stocks has already been done in the excel file provided. The remaining optimization is done using python language. The code is uploaded.
